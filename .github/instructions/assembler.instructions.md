# Copilot Instructions for Softsynth Assembler in This Project

## 1. Optimization

- The most important goal is minimizing the size of the binary.
- Always optimize for reduced binary size, even if it means sacrificing some performance or readability.
- Prefer shorter instruction sequences, avoid unnecessary code or data, and use the smallest possible data types and encodings.
- Don't use subroutines of functions unless they reduce overall size.
